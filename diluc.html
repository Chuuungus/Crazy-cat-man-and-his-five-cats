                <p>"Mr. Tiny little brain cell/ Captain Stinky/ Toilet sentinel"</p>
                
                <p>Diluc does not understand the concept of caution or danger. Which explains why he keeps running into doors or walls and falling from high heights every now and then. He also does not understand the concept of personal space. He loves annoying his older sister Spartacus into playing with her. Even though she just wants her personal space. For some odd reason, Diluc likes to watch you do your thing while using the toilet, ensuring you have a safe 1 or 2. 

                    To tell the difference between him and his siblings is very difficult, especially between Spartacus and Kaeya. However, if you look closer, he will always have a confused look on his face. Also, he is the tallest in the tuxedo bunch.
                    
                    If you play with him and keep him entertained consistently. He will love you forever.</p>
