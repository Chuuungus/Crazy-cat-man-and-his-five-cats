        <p>"Needy little squeak"</p>
        <p>Kaeya is what the internet would call "smol". She is the smallest in the family and the cutest meows in my opinion. She will see you as her favourite grooming tool if she is comfortable being with you. Depending on her "needy metre" will either sit on your lap, chest or neck. If she does not get her dose of attention, she "squeak" at you until she is satisfied. Be warned. Cat butt may be pointing at you during this process of cuddles.

            To tell the difference between her and her siblings is her unique white chin and her very "smol" physique. 
            
            You can win her heart by being patient with her. Give the right amount of play and treats, and she will be your friend for life.</p>
