    <P>Barely one years old and is already taller than his older sister Loki, Thor is biggest boy in the house. Despite his big frame he is the most laid back and will just often sit next to you, sometimes will even sleep next to you if the conditions are right. However he doesn't quite now how to meow properly. He just squeaks.  </P>
